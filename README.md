# SSCED: Single-Shot Crime Event Detector with Multi-View Surveillance Image Dataset

We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, which consists of crime event-based surveillance images with well-informed annotations. The dataset has crime videos and images categorized into 12 different categories, including assault, drunk, swoon, and more, with a separate normal dataset extracted from scenes that ended five seconds before the crime, with a duration of 10 seconds. To evaluate the dataset, we narrowed down 13 categories to 6 (assault, robbery, swoon, kidnap, burglary, and normal) and conducted experiments on a total of 2,054,013 shuffled and randomly selected frames from the videos. We used four CNN models with a single transformer model for training and validation, with a smaller sub-dataset of 8,500 frames randomly extracted from each category video, totaling 51,000 frames. Despite a 1:40 ratio of the train-test split, the dataset performed well on common CNN models, achieving higher than 0.945 accuracy for every model, while leaving some challenges for the Transformer model.
